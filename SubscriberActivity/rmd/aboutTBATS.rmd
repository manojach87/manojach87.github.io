The TBATS model was introduced by De Livera, Hyndman & Snyder (2011, JASA). "TBATS" is an acronym which denotes its salient features:

#####  T - trigonometric regressors to model multiple-seasonalities
#####  B - Box-Cox transformations
#####  A - ARMA errors
#####  T - trend
#####  S - seasonality

This model can be thought of as the BATS model enhanced using the trigonometric regressors.
